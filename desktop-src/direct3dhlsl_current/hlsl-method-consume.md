# Consume Method

Removes a value from the end of the buffer.

### Signatures

```syntax
ElementType ConsumeStructuredBuffer<ElementType>::Consume();
```

## Return Value

The value removed (can be a structure).

The return type matches the type in the Object declaration. For example, a Texture2D object that was declared as "Texture2d<uint4> myTexture;" has a return value of type uint4.

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

None.

## Example
```HLSL
// None.
```
